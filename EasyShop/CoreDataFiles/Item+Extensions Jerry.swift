// this is called from the ItemListRow view that appears in the ItemList
// view. there's some question about what this means: if you put it on the list
// previously and have placed it into your shopping cart, should it still
// remain "selected"?  i will take the approach that it means that if the
// status of the item in kNotOnList, then we will change it to kOnListNotTaken,
// and otherwise, we will change the status to kNotOnList
